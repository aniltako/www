            <p>As a consultant, I spent most of my time developing with Microsoft technologies for almost 20 years. I have loved Visual Studio (Interdev at one time) as my coding environment. Lately, I have been using a MacBook Pro to do some cross platform development, but never really found anything that fit well for what I was trying to do. Sure, TextMate was probably my best option…I just didn’t spend enough time in it to care to tweak it to my needs.</p>
